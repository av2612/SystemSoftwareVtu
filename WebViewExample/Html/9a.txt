9.   a) Shell script that accepts file names specified as arguments and creates a shell script that contains this file as well as the code to recreate these files. Thus if the script generated by your script is executed, it would recreate the original files(This is same as the “bundle” script described by Brain W. Kernighan and Rob Pike in “ The Unix Programming Environment”, Prentice – Hall India).


#!/bin/bash

echo "#to unbundle,bash this file" for i
do

echo "echo $i 1>&2"

echo "cat >$i << 'End of $i'" cat $i
echo "End of $i" done
