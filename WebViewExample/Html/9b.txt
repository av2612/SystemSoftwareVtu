b) C program to do the following: Using fork( ) create a child process. The child process prints its own process-id and id of its parent and then exits. The parent process waits for its child to finish (by executing the wait( )) and prints its own process-id and the id of its child process and then exits.



#include <stdio.h>


#include <stdlib.h>


#include <unistd.h>


int main()


{


pid_t cpid,ppid,pid;


if((pid=fork())<0)


{


printf("Fork error");


exit(0);


}


if(pid==0)


{


printf("\n I am Child");


printf("\n My id is %d", getpid()); printf("\n My parent id is %d", getppid()); exit(0); 
}


else


{


wait();


printf("\n I am Parent");


printf("\n My id is %d", getpid());


printf("\n My child id is %d\n", pid);


}


}
